    1. As far back as I can remember when I was ten years old, I was hooked on an online game called Little Flower Fairy.     
    
    2. When I recall my earliest memories of the Internet. The first image of this game flashed through my mind. Almost all the girls in our class were playing this online game at that time. 

    3. After school, I couldn't wait to get home. I quickly turned on my computer and the first thing I did was to check my garden. 

    4. Then it's time to collect all kinds of flowers in the garden and plant new ones. Completing quests would help me upgrade faster. So I could pretty much stay in front of the computer for an afternoon at that time.

    5. This computer game has accompanied me through a lot of my childhood and has left me with great memories.
